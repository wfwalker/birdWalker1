bittern should have been on the list for November 1998 central valley trip!

no sightings for massachusets?

italicize new birds in the year list

don't use "first sighting" or italics in the order report (why do some get it and some dont??)

NO! have to in-line the two-column-table code so we can pass modes through it?

don't rerun the autogenerated ant build files, or else mod dates get clobbered all the time!

since we don't regenerate sources/indices/*, those date-based dependencies never work properly

try using two letters for each column in year report

styles from species names in year report are overridden by styles used to show alternating colors

DONE in year report, use "e" instead of "X" for excluded sightings?

why don't the june 2002 trips appear in the 2002 year list? DEPENDENCY PROBLEM
